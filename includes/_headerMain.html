      <h4 class="h6 fontDefault">BOXED WARNING: DERMATOLOGIC TOXICITY</h4><strong>
        <u>Dermatologic Toxicity:</u> Dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients receiving Vectibix
         monotherapy </strong><em>[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</em>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In Study 20020408, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients with mCRC receiving Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>. The clinical manifestations included, but were not limited to, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, erythema, rash, skin exfoliation, paronychia, dry skin, and skin fissures.</li>
        <li>
           Monitor patients who develop dermatologic or soft tissue toxicities while receiving Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> for the development of inflammatory or infectious sequelae. Life-threatening and fatal infectious complications including necrotizing fasciitis, abscesses, and sepsis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>. Life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing has also been observed in patients treated with Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>. It could not be determined whether these mucocutaneous adverse reactions were directly related to EGFR inhibition or to idiosyncratic immune-related effects (eg, Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis). Withhold or discontinue Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> for dermatologic or soft tissue toxicity associated with severe or life-threatening inflammatory or infectious complications. Dose modifications for Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> concerning dermatologic toxicity are provided in the product labeling.</li>
        <li>
           Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> is not indicated for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer that harbor somatic <em> RAS</em> mutations in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) of either <em> KRAS</em> or <em> NRAS</em> and hereafter is referred to as "<em>RAS</em>."</li>
        <li>
           Retrospective subset analyses across several randomized clinical trials were conducted to investigate the role of <em> RAS</em> mutations on the clinical effects of anti-EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies (panitumumab or cetuximab). Anti-EGFR antibodies in patients with tumors containing <em> RAS</em> mutations resulted in exposing those patients to anti-EGFR related adverse reactions without clinical benefit from these agents. Additionally, in Study 20050203, 272 patients with <em> RAS</em>-mutant mCRC tumors received Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> in combination with FOLFOX and 276 patients received FOLFOX alone. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, OS was shorter (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.45) in patients with <em> RAS</em>-mutant mCRC who received Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> and FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone.</li>
        <li>
           Progressively decreasing serum magnesium levels leading to severe (grade 3-4) hypomagnesemia occurred in up to 7% (in Study 20080763) of patients across clinical trials. Monitor patients for hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> treatment, periodically during Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after the completion of treatment. Other electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, have also been observed. Replete magnesium and other electrolytes as appropriate.</li>
        <li>
           In Study 20020408, 4% of patients experienced infusion reactions and 1% of patients experienced severe infusion reactions (NCI-CTC grade 3-4). Infusion reactions, manifesting as fever, chills, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypotension, can occur following Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> administration. Fatal infusion reactions occurred in postmarketing experience. Terminate the infusion for severe infusion reactions.</li>
        <li>
           Severe diarrhea and dehydration, leading to acute renal failure and other complications, have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> in combination with chemotherapy.</li>
        <li>
           Fatal and nonfatal cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (1%) and pulmonary fibrosis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>. Pulmonary fibrosis occurred in less than 1% (2/1467) of patients enrolled in clinical studies of Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>. In the event of acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms interrupt Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> therapy. Discontinue Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> therapy if ILD is confirmed.</li>
        <li>
           In patients with a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, the benefits of therapy with Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> versus the risk of pulmonary complications must be carefully considered.</li>
        <li>
           Exposure to sunlight can exacerbate dermatologic toxicity. Advise patients to wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun exposure while receiving Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>.</li>
        <li>
           Keratitis and ulcerative keratitis, known risk factors for corneal perforation, have been reported with Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> use. Monitor for evidence of keratitis or ulcerative keratitis. Interrupt or discontinue Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> for acute or worsening keratitis.</li>
        <li>
           In an interim analysis of an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial in the first-line setting in patients with mCRC, the addition of Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> to the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy resulted in decreased OS and increased incidence of NCI-CTC grade 3-5 (87% vs 72%) adverse reactions. NCI-CTC grade 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher rate in Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>-treated patients included rash/acneiform dermatitis (26% vs 1%), diarrhea (23% vs 12%), dehydration (16% vs 5%), primarily occurring in patients with diarrhea, hypokalemia (10% vs 4%), stomatitis/mucositis (4% vs &lt; 1%), and hypomagnesemia (4% vs 0).</li>
        <li>
           NCI-CTC grade 3-5 pulmonary embolism occurred at a higher rate in Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>-treated patients (7% vs 3%) and included fatal events in three (&lt; 1%) Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>-treated patients. As a result of the toxicities experienced, patients randomized to Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy received a lower mean relative dose intensity of each chemotherapeutic agent (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bolus 5-FU, and/or infusional 5-FU) over the first 24 weeks on study compared with those randomized to bevacizumab and chemotherapy.</li>
        <li>
           Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for at least 2 months after the last dose of Vectibix<span>&reg;</span>.</li>
        <li>
           In monotherapy, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients with Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> were skin rash with variable presentations, paronychia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.</li>
        <li>
           The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) with Vectibix<span>&reg;</span> + FOLFOX were diarrhea, stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, paronychia, anorexia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, rash, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, and dry skin. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2% difference between treatment arms) were diarrhea and dehydration. </li>
